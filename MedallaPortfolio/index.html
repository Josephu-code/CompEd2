	<h2 class="fontweight">Introduction</h2>
	<p>Hi! I'm Joseph Medalla. I'm currently 21 years old. 
	I'm currently a full-time student in the University of the Philippines Open University taking taking the BAMS (Bachelor of Arts in Multimedia Studies) program.</p>
	
	<p>As a full-time student, I decided to use this as a simulation or test work for my future creative portfolio. I believe that I have not accrued enough
	good quality creative works for me to showcase my abilities. </p>

	<h2 class="fontweight">Experience and Occasions I've used it on</h2>       <!-- I didn't have much to add as I haven't been exposed to venues where I can use these experiences --->
<table style="width:80%">
  <tr>
    <th>Skills</th>
	<th>Skill level</th>
    <th>Venues to see my work</th>

  <tr>
    <td>Photography</td>   <!--- included here is editing --->
	<td>Medium to High</td>
    <td>Instagram and Facebook</td>

	<p> I haven't considered any sites where I can showcase my work. Most of my skills are of amateur skill level and developing so I'm opening myself to venues where I can receive advice and criticism. </p>
